# CarnotAgents

A comprehensive LLM agent system inspired by the Carnot engine principle - maximizing efficiency in transforming requests into completed work through iterative cycles.

## Overview

CarnotAgents combines advanced LLM framework integration with autonomous agent architectures to create systems that can receive requests or questions and iteratively work on them to move entire projects and documents forward. Like a Carnot engine achieving maximum thermodynamic efficiency, these agents optimize the conversion of input queries into valuable output through systematic, iterative processes.

## Core Architecture

### 1. Carnot Framework Components
- **Agent Delegation Systems**: Hierarchical agent coordination and task distribution
- **Document Generation Pipelines**: Autonomous document creation and enhancement systems  
- **Self-Improving Architectures**: Systems that evolve and optimize their own processes
- **Shared Architecture Foundations**: Common patterns and utilities across agent systems

### 2. LLM Framework Integration
- **Multi-Framework Support**: Unified interfaces for LangChain, AutoGen, LiteLLM, and LlamaIndex
- **Model Abstraction**: Framework-agnostic model access and configuration
- **Agent Orchestration**: Multi-agent system patterns and coordination
- **Framework Adapters**: Standardized interfaces across different LLM frameworks

- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient resource utilization across different providers

## Usage Patterns

### Basic Agent Setup
```python
from CarnotAgents.Core.framework_adapter import FrameworkAdapter
from CarnotAgents.Agents.carnot_agent import CarnotAgent

# Initialize with preferred framework
adapter = FrameworkAdapter.create('langchain')  # or 'autogen', 'litellm'
agent = CarnotAgent(adapter)

# Execute iterative work cycle
result = agent.process_request("Improve the documentation for this project")
```

### Multi-Agent Coordination
```python
from CarnotAgents.References.Agent_Delegation import HierarchicalSystem

# Create agent hierarchy
system = HierarchicalSystem()
system.add_specialist_agent('researcher', research_capabilities)
system.add_specialist_agent('writer', document_generation)
system.add_coordinator_agent('manager', coordination_logic)

# Execute complex multi-step tasks
result = system.execute_project("Create comprehensive API documentation")
```

### Document Generation Pipeline
```python
from CarnotAgents.References.Document_Generation import DocumentPipeline

# Set up autonomous document creation
pipeline = DocumentPipeline()
pipeline.configure_sources(project_files, research_papers, specifications)

# Generate and iteratively improve documents
docs = pipeline.generate_documentation(scope="API Reference", style="technical")
improved_docs = pipeline.iterative_enhancement(docs, improvement_cycles=3)
```
