# CarnotAgents Research & Experiments

This directory contains experimental features, research prototypes, and future explorations that are not yet part of the core CarnotAgents system.

## Current Research Areas

### PersistentAgents
Research into always-on AI agents that maintain continuous reasoning loops, self-reflection capabilities, and long-term memory systems. This explores how agents can:
- Maintain context and continue thinking about problems over extended periods
- Use techniques like Tree-of-Thoughts, Reflexion, and MemGPT
- Balance persistence with computational efficiency (key synergy with Carnot principles)

**Status**: Early research phase - not integrated into main system

## Integration Philosophy

Research in this directory follows these principles:
1. **Exploratory**: Ideas here are experimental and may not become core features
2. **Synergistic**: Research should connect to CarnotAgents' efficiency principles
3. **Documented**: Each research area maintains its own documentation
4. **Isolated**: Experimental code doesn't affect the main system stability

## Future Research Opportunities

- Quantum-inspired optimization for agent decision making
- Distributed agent coordination protocols
- Energy-aware agent architectures
- Formal verification of agent behaviors

*Research here informs but doesn't define the core CarnotAgents system. Ideas graduate to the main system only after thorough validation.*
