# PersistentAgents Research Project

## Overview

Research into persistent AI agents that maintain continuous reasoning loops, self-reflection capabilities, and long-term memory systems. These systems represent a evolution from traditional request-response AI toward always-on, autonomous reasoning agents.

## Core Focus Areas

### Continuous Reasoning Systems
- **Tree-of-Thoughts**: Branching and backtracking search over reasoning paths
- **Reflexion**: Verbal self-critique and iterative improvement
- **MemGPT**: Hierarchical virtual context for scalable long-term memory
- **Self-RAG**: On-demand retrieval with self-reflection loops

### Commercial Applications Research
- Decision agents (OpenAI Operator, Adept ACT-1)
- Knowledge filters (AlphaSense Smart Summaries, Crayon)
- Personal memory systems (Rewind AI)
- Domain-specific living reviews

### Technical Infrastructure
- Memory compression and distillation algorithms
- Auto-evaluation frameworks for reasoning depth
- Safety and budget control mechanisms
- Domain-specific vertical SaaS opportunities

2. **Auto-Evaluation**: How to measure reasoning depth and quality automatically?
3. **Resource Management**: How to balance persistence with computational optimization?
4. **Safety Mechanisms**: How to implement robust guard-rails for autonomous systems?

### Commercial Opportunities
1. **Vertical SaaS**: Which domains beyond finance/health have persistent agent needs?
2. **Infrastructure Tools**: What developer tools are needed for persistent agent deployment?
3. **Evaluation Services**: Market opportunity for agent reasoning benchmarks and evaluation?
4. **Memory-as-a-Service**: Potential for specialized memory management services?
