# CarnotAgents Consolidation Notes

## Current Import Status
✅ Imported from: `/Users/rezajamei/Desktop/HQ_stable/ResearchExperiments/CarnotAgents`
✅ Imported PersistentAgents research: `/Users/rezajamei/Desktop/HQ_stable/ResearchExperiments/PersistentAgents`
   - Added to Research/ directory as experimental feature
   - Not part of core system, but informs future development

## Other Locations to Check
As mentioned, CarnotAgents materials are scattered in multiple locations. Please check:
- [ ] Other directories on Desktop
- [ ] Downloads folder
- [ ] Any cloud storage locations
- [ ] Previous project folders

## What We Have So Far

### Core Components
1. **Agent Systems**
   - Agent Delegation (hierarchical coordination)
   - Document Generation pipelines
   - Self-improving architectures
   - Renaissance document processing system

2. **Framework Integrations**
   - LangChain
   - AutoGen
   - LiteLLM
   - LlamaIndex

3. **Key Concepts**
   - Carnot efficiency principle applied to AI
   - Iterative improvement cycles
   - Framework-agnostic design
   - Autonomous operation

## Integration Opportunities
- **ArxivPipeline**: Use for finding relevant papers on agent systems
- **ConversationDigest**: Process agent conversations for insights
- **RLAgents**: Apply RL to agent behavior optimization
- **TransformersResearch**: Use transformers in agent architectures

## Next Steps
1. Consolidate remaining scattered materials
2. Clean up duplicate files
3. Organize into clearer structure
4. Update documentation with unified vision
5. Create working examples
6. Build integration points with other HQ projects

## Questions to Address
- What specific problem domains are we targeting?
- How do we measure "efficiency" in the Carnot sense?
- What are the key differentiators from generic agent systems?
- How do we handle agent coordination and communication?
