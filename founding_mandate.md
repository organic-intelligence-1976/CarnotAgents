# CarnotAgents: Founding Mandate

## Vision

CarnotAgents aims to create the most efficient LLM agent system by applying Carnot optimization principles to autonomous AI work cycles. CarnotAgents will achieve maximum efficiency in converting user requests into completed projects through systematic, iterative agent processes.

## Mission

To develop a unified LLM agent ecosystem that:
1. Receives complex requests or questions from users
2. Iteratively works on them through autonomous agent cycles
3. Moves entire projects and documents forward systematically
4. Maximizes productive output while minimizing computational waste
5. Integrates seamlessly across multiple LLM frameworks and providers

## Core Principles

### 1. Carnot Optimization Principle
CarnotAgents optimizes the conversion of:
- **Input**: User requests, questions, project requirements
- **Output**: Completed work, improved documents, advanced projects
- **Work Cycle**: Systematic agent processes that maximize productive transformation

### 2. Iterative Improvement
Agents operate in cycles, with each iteration building upon previous work:
- Analysis and planning phases
- Execution and implementation phases  
- Review and optimization phases
- Continuous refinement and enhancement

### 3. Framework Agnosticism
Universal compatibility across LLM frameworks:
- Standardized interfaces for LangChain, AutoGen, LiteLLM, LlamaIndex
- Seamless switching between providers and models
- Consistent agent behavior regardless of underlying framework

### 4. Autonomous Operation
Agents capable of independent work with minimal human intervention:
- Self-directed task breakdown and execution
- Intelligent error recovery and adaptation
- Continuous learning and self-improvement

## Strategic Integration
