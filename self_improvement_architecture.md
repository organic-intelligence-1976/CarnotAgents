└────────────┘     └────────────┘     └────────────┘
```

### Process Stages

1. **Measure**: Collect performance data across all system levels
2. **Analyze**: Identify patterns, bottlenecks, and improvement opportunities
3. **Hypothesize**: Generate theories about potential improvements
4. **Design**: Create specific modifications to implement improvements
5. **Implement**: Apply changes to the system
6. **Evaluate**: Assess the impact of changes

This cycle operates continuously at multiple time scales:
- **Fast cycle** (seconds to minutes): Agent-level prompt adjustments
- **Medium cycle** (hours to days): System-level delegation optimizations
- **Slow cycle** (days to weeks): Knowledge structure reorganizations
