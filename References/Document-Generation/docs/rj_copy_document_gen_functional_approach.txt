# Universal Problem Solver: A Functional Approach to LLM-Driven Problem Solving

## Core Concept
A universal problem solver that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) through a simple but powerful state-based architecture, designed with functional programming principles.

## Building Blocks

### 1. Core Types
```haskell
State = Map CellId String × Optional CellId
Config = Map PromptName String
LLMResponse = String
```

### 2. Core Components
- State representation (cells with content and current focus)
- State transformation loop
- LLM interface
- Configuration system

### 3. Core Functions
```haskell
solve : Query → State → Config → LLMInterface → Solution
where solve(query, state, config, llm) = 
    if isSolved(state) then getSolution(state)
    else solve(query, nextState(state, llm(formatState(state))), config, llm)

nextState : State → LLMResponse → State
formatState : State → String
parseResponse : LLMResponse → Either ErrorMessage State
```

### 4. Operational Flow
1. Show current state to LLM
2. Get next action or solution
3. Parse and apply changes
4. Repeat until solved

### 5. Two Levels of Operation
#### Base Level
- Problem-solving loop using current configuration
- State transformation through LLM interaction
- Robust parsing and error handling

#### Meta Level
```haskell
improveConfig : Code → Config → [Log] → Config
```
- Configuration improvement system
- Self-analysis capabilities
- System evolution through experience

## Key Design Principles

### 1. Functional Programming Concepts
- Pure Functions: State transitions produce new states without mutation
- Composition: System built from simple function compositions
- Recursion: Main solving loop is recursive
- Higher-Order Functions: LLM interface and config improvement system
- Immutability: States and configurations are immutable

### 2. Core System as Function Composition
```haskell
solve = getSolution ∘ iterate (nextState ∘ llm ∘ formatState)
```

### 3. Essential Loop
```haskell
solve query = 
    fix (λstate → 
        if isSolved state 
        then state
        else nextState (llm (formatState state)))
```

## Interfaces

### 1. State → Text
- Converting internal state to LLM-readable format
- Clear, consistent representation

### 2. LLM Response → State Changes
- Robust parsing of LLM outputs
- Error handling and recovery
- Multiple fallback mechanisms

### 3. Meta-Level Interface
- Code + Config + Logs → Improved Config
- Self-improvement capability
- Configuration evolution

## Safety and Robustness

### 1. Error Handling
- Graceful handling of malformed LLM responses
- Multiple fallback levels
- State validity preservation

### 2. Separation of Concerns
- Clear separation between code and configuration
- Isolated LLM interaction
- Pure functional core

## Power Through Simplicity
The system's effectiveness comes from:
1. Simple, composable pieces
2. Clear functional design
3. Trust in LLM capabilities
4. Robust error handling
5. Self-improvement capacity

The architecture combines the mathematical elegance of functional programming with practical robustness, creating a system that can:
- Solve complex problems
- Recover from errors
- Improve its own operation
- Maintain consistency and reliability

All of this is achieved through the composition of simple, well-defined functions and types, following the principle that complex behavior can emerge from simple, well-designed components interacting through clear interfaces.
