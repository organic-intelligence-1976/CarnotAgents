Final Description with Graph and tools 


At a high level, this is an AI orchestration system that breaks down complex problems into manageable pieces while maintaining structure and state. Here are the key building blocks:

1. Core State Management:
- `SystemState`: The immutable central state container
  - Holds content cells
  - Tracks relationships between cells (hierarchy/references)
  - Tracks current focus of attention
  - Manages tasks
- All state transitions are explicit and trackable

2. Content Units:
- `CellContent`: The atomic unit of information
  - Can contain text
  - Can contain tool calls
  - Can contain tasks
- `CellRelations`: Defines how cells connect
  - Parent-child relationships for hierarchy
  - References for cross-linking
  - Enables building larger structures from small pieces

3. Tool System:
- Defined set of operations available to the LLM
- Each tool is a pure function: input â†’ output
- Tools for:
  - Basic operations (calculator, weather)
  - Task management (create_task, list_tasks)
  - State manipulation

4. Task Management:
- `Task`: Structured units of work
  - Description and priority
  - Status tracking
  - Dependencies
  - Timestamps
- Built on top of existing cell structure

5. LLM Interface:
- Structured prompt format
- Clear protocol for:
  - State examination
  - Tool usage
  - Task creation
  - Solution declaration
- Multiple fallback mechanisms

6. Problem-Solving Loop:
- Initialize state from query
- Repeatedly:
  - Show current state to LLM
  - Get next action/state
  - Execute tools if needed
  - Update state
  - Check for solution
- Maintain history of all steps

The system is built like a "conversational operating system" where:
- The LLM is the decision maker
- Tools are like system calls
- Cells are like memory blocks
- Tasks are like processes
- State transitions are like transactions

Everything is designed to be:
- Immutable (state changes create new states)
- Trackable (all changes are recorded)
- Composable (small pieces build larger structures)
- Recoverable (multiple fallback mechanisms)
- Extensible (new tools/capabilities can be added)
