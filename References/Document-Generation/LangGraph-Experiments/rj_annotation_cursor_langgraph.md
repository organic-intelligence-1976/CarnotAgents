# Cursor-LangGraph Experiment

## Original Location
`/Users/rezajamei/Desktop/repos/cursor_langgraph_experiment/`

## Purpose
This experimental project explores a hybrid architecture that combines Renaissance's full-context approach with LangGraph's structured agent system. It aims to create a framework where agents can have both specialized roles and shared context awareness, with the ability to self-modify based on task requirements.

## Key Components

### Framework Documentation
- **README.md**: Overview of the hybrid architecture approach
- **SESSION_LOG.md**: Documented development sessions and insights

### Examples
- **wiki_research_assistant.py**: Implementation of a research assistant using Wikipedia
- **maintenance_example.py**: Example of a system maintenance workflow
- **task_based_maintenance.py**: Task-oriented maintenance implementation
- **basic_usage.py**: Basic usage patterns for the framework
- **template.ipynb**: Notebook template for experiments

### Documentation

## Content Description

The project explores a hybrid architecture with several key features:

1. **Structured Agent System**:
   - Distinct agents with specific responsibilities
   - Clear flow of control between agents
   - Structured message passing using LangGraph

2. **Shared Context**:
   - Agents can access a common context pool
   - Context visibility can be configured per agent
   - Support for both focused and broad awareness modes

3. **Self-Modification**:
   - Agents can propose improvements to their behavior
   - System can evolve based on experience
   - Dynamic adjustment to changing requirements

## Usage Context

This experimental framework can be used for:
- Developing more sophisticated document generation systems
- Creating research assistants with specialized components
- Building systems that can improve themselves over time
- Implementing complex workflows with multiple specialized agents

## Note on Document Generation Integration

This experimental framework offers several patterns that can enhance the Document Generation System:

1. **More Sophisticated Agent Structure**: The hybrid architecture could improve the existing LangGraph implementation
2. **Better Research Capabilities**: The wiki research assistant demonstrates how to incorporate external knowledge
3. **Self-Improvement**: The self-modification capabilities could make document generation more adaptive
4. **Context Management**: The shared context approach could improve document coherence across generation stages

These patterns complement the existing LangGraph implementation in the Document Generation System and provide directions for future enhancement.
