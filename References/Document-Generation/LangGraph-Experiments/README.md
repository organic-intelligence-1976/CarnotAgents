# LangGraph Experiments

This directory contains explorations and experiments with LangGraph, a framework for building stateful, multi-agent LLM applications. These examples complement the Document Generation System's LangGraph implementation with additional patterns and use cases.

## Contents

- `rj_copy_cursor_langgraph_README.md` - Overview of the Cursor-LangGraph experimental framework
- `rj_copy_wiki_research_assistant.py` - Wiki research assistant implementation using LangGraph

## Relation to Document Generation System

These experiments explore patterns that can enhance the Document Generation System:

1. **Hybrid Architecture**: Combines context sharing with structured agent systems
2. **Agent Specialization**: Demonstrates how to create specialized agents for different aspects of document generation
3. **Self-Improvement**: Explores agents that can modify their own behavior based on task requirements

## Integration Opportunities

The patterns demonstrated here can be integrated with the main Document Generation System:

1. **Enhanced LangGraph Implementation**: The existing LangGraph implementation can be enhanced with these patterns
2. **Research Integration**: The wiki research assistant shows how to incorporate external knowledge into documents
3. **Context Management**: The approaches to context sharing can improve document coherence across generation stages

## Future Development

These experiments provide a foundation for:

1. Developing more sophisticated multi-agent document generation
2. Implementing better research and fact-checking capabilities
3. Creating self-improving generation processes
4. Building more complex document workflows with specialized agent roles
