# Document Generation System Archive Candidates

This document tracks the files from the Document Generation System project that have been copied to our organization system.

## Original Repository
- Location: `/Users/rezajamei/Desktop/My General Document Generation System/`
- Type: Personal Project

## Copied Files

| Original Path | Copied To | Status |
|---------------|-----------|--------|
| `/Users/rezajamei/Desktop/My General Document Generation System/Final code v10 self improving` | `/Users/rezajamei/Desktop/HQ/Projects/Personal/Document-Generation-System/code/rj_copy_document_gen_v10_self_improving.txt` | ✅ Copied |
| `/Users/rezajamei/Desktop/My General Document Generation System/Final Description with Graph and tools` | `/Users/rezajamei/Desktop/HQ/Projects/Personal/Document-Generation-System/docs/rj_copy_document_gen_description.txt` | ✅ Copied |

## Remaining Files to Consider

The original directory contains several other files that may be worth copying:

| File | Priority | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| `Final code v9` | Medium | Version before self-improvement capability |
| `Final code v8` | Medium | Earlier version showing evolution |
| `Final code v7` | Low | Earlier version |
| `Final code v6` | Low | Earlier version |
| `Final code v4` | Medium | Earliest complete version |
| `Final description of v10` | High | Documentation specific to v10 |
| `Final description` | Medium | General description |
| `Enhanced Set of Principles:` | Medium | Architectural principles |
| `LangGraph and LangChain v2` | Medium | Integration with frameworks |
| `Final GPT suggestion` | Low | AI-generated suggestions |

## Strategy

For now, we've copied the most important files:
1. Latest code version (v10) with self-improvement
2. Main architectural description

Additional files can be copied based on need, focusing on those that show significant evolution points or provide important context.
