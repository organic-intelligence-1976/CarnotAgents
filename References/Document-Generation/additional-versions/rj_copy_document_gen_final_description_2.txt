Final description 

Here are the key building blocks of our final system:

1. Core Components:
   - A state representation (cells with content and a current focus)
   - A simple state transformation loop
   - An LLM interface that processes state and suggests next steps
   - Configuration that defines how to interact with the LLM

2. Operational Flow:
   - Show current state to LLM
   - Get next action or solution
   - Parse and apply changes
   - Repeat until solved

3. Two Levels of Operation:
   - Base Level: The problem-solving loop using current configuration
   - Meta Level: The configuration improvement system that can analyze and enhance the solver

4. Key Interfaces:
   - State → Text (for LLM consumption)
   - LLM Response → State Changes
   - Code + Config + Logs → Improved Config

5. Safety/Robustness Features:
   - Graceful handling of malformed LLM responses
   - Fallback mechanisms when things go wrong
   - Clear separation between code and configuration

The system is essentially a simple state machine where:
- The state is just text in cells
- The transition function is the LLM
- The rules for interaction are in the config
- The whole system can improve itself through meta-analysis

The power comes from combining these simple pieces in a way that leverages the LLM's capabilities while maintaining robustness and flexibility.
