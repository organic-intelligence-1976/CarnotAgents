Final description


Here are the core goals and solutions of our system:
Core Goals:

Enable LLMs to handle tasks that are currently impossible due to their limitations:

Exact computations with large numbers
Writing/editing very long documents
Maintaining perfect consistency across complex tasks
Managing detailed state without errors


Allow LLMs to work beyond their context window limitations while maintaining reliability

Key Ideas We've Used:

Cell-Based Memory:

Break information into manageable chunks (cells)
Each cell contains text that the LLM can easily process
Cells can reference other cells, creating a network of information
LLM never needs to hold all information at once


State Management:

Explicit tracking of current status and progress
Clear documentation of what has been done and what's next
Ability to checkpoint and resume complex operations
Prevention of information loss during long processes


Self-Documenting Approach:

LLM creates its own conventions and documents them
System maintains records of how it's organizing information
Clear trails of decision-making and progress
Ability to review and understand previous work


Navigation and Access:

Directory system for finding information
Working set tracking for frequently used data
Ability to move between cells without loading everything
Efficient search and retrieval


Task-Agnostic Design:

Same basic system works for any type of task
No built-in assumptions about problem types
LLM decides how to structure each specific problem
Flexible enough for computation, writing, or analysis



The core insight is that by breaking tasks into small, manageable pieces and maintaining explicit state, we can help LLMs overcome their limitations while leveraging their strengths in understanding and processing text.
For example:

For large computations: Break them into single-digit operations
For long documents: Maintain structure and cross-references between sections
For complex tasks: Track progress and state explicitly
For consistency: Keep clear records and references

The system acts like an external memory and organization tool that lets the LLM focus on what it does best - understanding and processing small pieces of text - while managing the larger structure of the task automatically.
