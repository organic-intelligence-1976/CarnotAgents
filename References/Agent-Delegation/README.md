# Agent Delegation Framework

This directory contains experiments and implementations related to agent delegation patterns, where tasks are broken down and assigned to specialized agents or "minions" for execution.

## Contents

- `rj_copy_minion.py` - Implementation of the minion delegation framework
- `rj_copy_minion_instructions.txt` - Instructions for minion agents
- `rj_copy_minion_problem_statement.txt` - Example problem for minion agents to solve

## Purpose

This project area explores:

1. Task decomposition and delegation patterns for LLM agents
2. Coordination mechanisms between supervisor and worker agents
3. Specialized role definition for different aspects of problem solving
4. State management across delegated tasks

## Delegation Patterns

The current implementation demonstrates:

- **Task Assignment**: How supervisor agents can assign tasks to worker agents
- **File-Based Communication**: Using file system for state persistence and information exchange
- **Utility Functions**: Common tools provided to all agents for consistent task execution

## Future Development

This project can be expanded to include:

- More sophisticated coordination protocols
- Dynamic agent creation based on task requirements
- Agent specialization with customized tools and capabilities
- Evaluation and feedback mechanisms for completed tasks
- Integration with other agent frameworks like AutoGen
