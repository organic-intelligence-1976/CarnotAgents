# Shared Architecture Components

This directory contains architectural documentation and components that are shared between multiple projects, particularly the Pinnochio and Document Generation System projects.

## Contents

- `rj_copy_core_system_architecture.txt` - Documentation of the core system architecture including memory and state management
- `rj_copy_architectural_foundations.txt` - Foundational principles and design patterns
- `rj_copy_recursive_llm.py` - Python implementation of recursive LLM processing

## Purpose

These files represent the common architectural foundations that underpin multiple projects. They were originally found in various locations (primarily on the Desktop) and have been consolidated here to provide a central reference point for the shared architectural concepts.

## Related Projects

- [Document Generation System](/Projects/Personal/Document-Generation-System) - Implementation focused on document generation
- [Pinnochio](/Projects/Experiments/Pinnochio) - Implementation with self-improving capabilities

## Notes

These architectural components demonstrate the unified approach across projects, with common themes including:

- Cell-based memory structures
- Hierarchical organization
- State preservation
- Pattern-based access
- Unified memory models
- Recursive processing

The files in this directory should be considered in conjunction with the specific implementations in the related project directories.
