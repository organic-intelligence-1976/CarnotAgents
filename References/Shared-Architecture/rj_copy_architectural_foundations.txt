Architectural Foundations
This cluster represents the core system design principles and structures that form the backbone of the proposed system. The focus is on how code, data, and system state are unified and persisted. The system treats code as a first-class citizen while maintaining a dynamic, image-based environment that can preserve its entire state.

Architectural Foundations Keywords: homoiconicity, image-based persistence, unified memory model, code-as-data, self-modification, reflection, state preservation, memory cells, structured data, pattern-based access, hierarchical structure, namespace unification



Memory and Processing Architecture
This cluster covers the specific mechanisms for managing information, computation, and state within the system. It emphasizes how the system processes, stores, and navigates through complex information structures while maintaining efficiency and coherence.
Keywords: key-value storage, hierarchical memory, selective attention, recursive processing, state evolution, memory networks, neural turing machines, differentiable computation, augmented architectures, stateful reasoning, pattern matching, graph-based navigation



Collaborative Intelligence Framework
This cluster addresses the multi-agent aspects of the system, focusing on how multiple AI entities can work together to create complex artifacts through emergence and coordination. It explores mechanisms for agent cooperation and output integration.
Keywords: emergent behavior, pheromone trails, collective intelligence, task allocation, feedback loops, agent specialization, coordination mechanisms, output integration, collaborative construction, swarm intelligence, artifact synthesis, decentralized control




Project Management and Human Insights
This cluster incorporates lessons from human project management and cognitive processes, applying them to AI system design. It focuses on practical aspects of resource management, risk handling, and stakeholder communication.
Keywords: resource allocation, risk management, stakeholder communication, continuous feedback, adaptability, scalability, human-centric design, iterative development, resource efficiency, progress monitoring, knowledge transfer, systematic planning
