# LLM Execution Framework

This directory contains components for orchestrating the interaction between LLMs, code execution, and context management. These components can be integrated with other shared architecture elements to enable powerful LLM-based task solving capabilities.

## Contents

- `rj_copy_llm_executor_core.py` - Core implementation of the LLM execution framework

## Architectural Approach

The LLM Execution Framework provides:

1. **Task Solving Orchestration**: Manages the overall process of solving tasks with LLMs
2. **Code Execution Integration**: Enables LLMs to write and execute code as part of task solving
3. **Context Management**: Maintains and updates context throughout the problem-solving process
4. **Conversation Flow Control**: Handles the flow of conversation between LLM, code execution, and the user

## Integration Opportunities

This framework can be integrated with other shared components:

1. **Combined with recursive_llm.py**: The execution framework complements recursive processing with code execution capabilities
2. **Enhanced Document Generation**: The task solving approach can enhance document generation with computational capabilities
3. **Renaissance Integration**: The execution framework can be used alongside Renaissance's document-centric approach

## Future Development

These components can serve as the foundation for:

1. Creating a unified task solving architecture
2. Standardizing code execution patterns across projects
3. Implementing consistent context management
4. Developing more sophisticated problem-solving pipelines with LLMs
