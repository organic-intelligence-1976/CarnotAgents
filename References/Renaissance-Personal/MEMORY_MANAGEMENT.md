# Memory Management in Renaissance

This document explores approaches for improving how Renaissance handles information over multiple iterations, particularly focusing on distinguishing between relevant, obsolete, and resolved content.

## The Problem

During testing with the Wikipedia lookup example, we observed that:

1. The system successfully self-corrects errors (e.g., missing imports)
2. However, as iterations progress, the document accumulates information without clear distinction between:
   - Resolved issues that are no longer relevant
   - Historical context that may still be useful
   - Currently active problems and tasks
   - New information that builds on previous work

As problem complexity increases, this lack of structured memory management could lead to:
- Confusion about current state vs. historical issues
- Cluttered documents that obscure important information
- Fixation on already-solved problems
- Inefficient use of context window

## Proposed Approaches

### 1. Structured Status Tracking

Add explicit status metadata to content sections:
```python
<new_section name="Issues_Tracker">
- [RESOLVED] Missing 'os' import in execution context - fixed in iteration 2
- [ACTIVE] Wikipedia API rate limiting - exploring alternatives
- [PENDING] File permission verification before writing
</new_section>
```

**Pros:**
- Clear labeling of problem status
- Provides a central location for tracking issues
- Simple to implement

**Cons:**
- Requires manual maintenance
- May become unwieldy for many issues
- Doesn't actually remove or condense old content

### 2. Temporal Decay Mechanism

Implement a "recency weighting" system where information gradually fades in prominence:
- Add timestamps to each section update
- Visually dim or collapse older content
- Provide a command to "archive" resolved issues while keeping them accessible

**Pros:**
- Automatic prioritization of recent content
- Maintains history but reduces its visual dominance
- Mimics human memory attention patterns

**Cons:**
- Requires UI changes to implement visual fading
- May accidentally de-emphasize important but older information
- More complex to implement

### 3. Memory Management Tags

Give the LLM explicit tools to manage document memory:
```python
<archive_section name="Old_Error_Logs">
Content to move to archived state but remain accessible if needed
</archive_section>

<mark_resolved issue="missing-import">
The missing import issue has been fixed by adding 'import os'
</mark_resolved>
```

**Pros:**
- Gives the LLM explicit control over memory
- Provides semantic meaning to memory operations
- Can be implemented with existing tag processing mechanisms

**Cons:**
- Requires teaching the LLM to use new tags
- Might be used inconsistently
- Adds complexity to the system prompt

### 4. Document Summarization Layer

Periodically generate a "current state" summary:
- After every N iterations, prompt for a document summary
- This summary replaces older content with concise status updates
- Only the most recent full details are kept, with historical content summarized

**Pros:**
- Creates compact representation of historical context
- Mimics human note-taking behavior
- Reduces context size without losing critical information

**Cons:**
- Summarization may lose important details
- Adds computational overhead for summary generation
- Requires determining optimal summarization frequency

### 5. Section Versioning

Track section changes with version numbers:
```python
<update_section name="Implementation" version="3">
Updated implementation with proper imports and error handling
</update_section>
```

**Pros:**
- Clear progression of development
- Can be combined with diff-like viewing
- Simple to understand

**Cons:**
- Doesn't address content organization
- May lead to version proliferation
- Requires version management logic

### 6. Working Memory Pruning

Automatically or manually prune the working memory:
- Add a `<prune_working_memory>` tag that selectively removes resolved issues
- Implement time-based or size-based automatic pruning
- Keep only the most recent N errors/outputs unless explicitly preserved

**Pros:**
- Directly addresses context size limitations
- Can be tuned based on task complexity
- Mimics human "forgetting" of resolved issues

**Cons:**
- Risk of removing information that becomes relevant later
- Requires criteria for what to keep vs. prune
- May remove useful context for debugging

### 7. Hierarchical Context Structure

Restructure the document to have different layers of context:
- "Recent Context" (last 1-2 iterations)
- "Working Context" (current problems and immediate history)
- "Background Context" (established knowledge, resolved issues)
- Allow the LLM to move content between these layers

**Pros:**
- Organizes information by relevance and recency
- Provides clear mental model for information organization
- Scalable to complex problems

**Cons:**
- More complex document structure
- Requires LLM to understand hierarchical organization
- May increase cognitive load for users

## Implementation Considerations

Any solution should balance:

1. **Automatic vs. Manual Management**: How much should be handled by the system vs. the LLM?
2. **Complexity vs. Simplicity**: More sophisticated approaches may be powerful but harder to implement and use
3. **Context Window Efficiency**: Solutions must optimize for limited context windows
4. **Information Preservation**: Critical context should not be lost
5. **User Experience**: The approach should feel natural and not require excessive management

## Next Steps

Before committing to a specific approach:

1. Conduct experiments with different memory management strategies on complex problems
2. Evaluate how each approach affects:
   - Task completion success
   - Iteration efficiency
   - Context window usage
   - User comprehension
3. Consider combining multiple approaches (e.g., status tracking + summarization)
4. Test with different LLM providers to ensure broad compatibility
