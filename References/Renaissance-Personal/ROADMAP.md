# Renaissance Project Roadmap

This document outlines the current state of the Renaissance project, planned improvements, and long-term vision. It should be updated regularly as the project evolves.

## Current State (Last Updated: March 2, 2025)

Renaissance provides a document-centric approach to LLM problem solving with:

- A structured document as the core state representation
- Iterative improvement via step function architecture
- XML-based tag system for LLM-system communication
- Multiple LLM provider support (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, MLX)
- Configurable prompts and behaviors via JSON configuration files
- Different modes for various problem types (research, coding, exploration)

## Strengths and Limitations

### Current Strengths
- **Document-Centric Architecture**: Maintains persistent memory beyond chat history limitations
- **Structured Communication**: Clear XML protocol for LLM-system interaction
- **Iterative Problem-Solving**: Step function approach allows incremental progress
- **Flexible Configuration**: JSON-based configs for different use cases
- **Provider-Agnostic**: Works with multiple LLM providers

### Current Limitations
- **Context Management**: No built-in chunking for very large documents
- **Scalability**: As documents grow, LLMs struggle to maintain focus on all relevant information
- **Processing Overhead**: Large monolithic documents become computationally expensive
- **Error Handling**: Could be more robust for production scenarios
- **Tools Integration**: Limited native support for external API calls or tools
- **Document Flow Control**: Basic workflow guidance
- **Navigability**: Large documents become difficult for both LLMs and humans to navigate

## Short-Term Improvements (Next 1-3 Months)

### Priority 1: Document Scaling
- ✅ Implemented details_dict storage system for managing verbose content (March 2, 2025)
- ✅ Added Table of Contents feature for document navigation (March 5, 2025)
- ✅ Implemented document history tracking across iterations (March 5, 2025)
- Implement automatic chunking of large documents
- Create summarization capabilities for document sections
- Add selective context loading based on relevance

### Priority 2: Tool Integration
- Design a standard protocol for LLMs to use external tools
- Implement basic tool integrations (search, data processing)
- Add support for file system operations beyond code execution

### Priority 3: User Experience
- Create a simplified high-level API for common use cases
- Improve error messages and debugging capabilities
- Develop basic visualization for document evolution

## Medium-Term Roadmap (3-6 Months)

### Workflow Enhancements
- Implement workflow templates for common tasks
- Add support for sub-tasks and task decomposition
- Create checkpointing and branching capabilities

### Evaluation Framework
- Build evaluation metrics for solution quality
- Implement self-critique capabilities
- Create a benchmarking suite for different configurations

### Integration Ecosystem
- Develop integrations with popular data tools
- Add web interface components
- Create exporters for different formats

## Long-Term Vision (6+ Months)

### Advanced Research Capabilities
- Multi-agent collaboration within the document
- Automatic literature review and citation
- Hypothesis generation and testing

### Scaling and Complexity Management
- **File I/O for Data Management**: Store large datasets, detailed analysis results, and code modules in external files with the main document containing only summaries and references
- **Hierarchical Documents**: Break down large research problems into smaller sub-problems handled by separate "child" documents with their own goals and task queues
- **Parallel Processing**: Enable multiple sub-processes to work concurrently on different aspects of a complex problem
- **Dynamic Resource Allocation**: Intelligently allocate computational resources based on sub-task complexity

### Enterprise Features
- Authentication and access control
- Audit logging and compliance features
- Custom enterprise integrations

### Domain-Specific Extensions
- Education-focused workflows
- Scientific research templates
- Software development lifecycle support

## Implementation Strategy

The development focus will follow these principles:

1. **Modular Construction**: Each feature should be implemented as a modular component
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Preserve existing API patterns when possible
3. **Documentation First**: Update documentation alongside or before code changes
4. **Test Coverage**: Maintain comprehensive tests for all new features
5. **User Feedback**: Regularly collect and incorporate user feedback

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to any of the areas outlined in this roadmap. Please feel free to:

1. Submit pull requests for specific improvements
2. Suggest additional features or priorities
3. Report bugs or issues with current functionality
4. Improve documentation or provide examples

## Proto-Researcher Integration (2025-03-07)

We've successfully implemented and tested Proto-Researcher-inspired document structure enhancements:

- Restructured default configuration with TaskQueue, WorkingMemory, KnowledgeBase, and CodeRepository sections
- Added explicit task tracking with checkbox formatting for progress indication 
- Created structured document organization approach with specialized sections
- Tested file persistence capabilities across multiple iterations
- Enhanced process_evaluation_test.py script to support custom configurations

Next steps for this integration include:
1. Implementing structured file organization for artifacts
2. Adding automatic tracking of created files in CodeRepository
3. Enhancing task decomposition capabilities
4. Documenting best practices for section usage

## Revision History

- **March 7, 2025**: Added Proto-Researcher integration features and updated default configuration
- **March 5, 2025**: Updated with completed document scaling features (Table of Contents and document history tracking)
- **March 2, 2025**: Initial roadmap created with short and medium-term goals
