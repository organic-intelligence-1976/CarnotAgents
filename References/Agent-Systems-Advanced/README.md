# Cursor-LangGraph Experiment

An experimental framework that combines the benefits of Renaissance's full-context approach with LangGraph's structured agent system.

## Core Concept

This experiment explores a hybrid architecture that:

1. **Maintains Core Agent Structure**
   - Distinct agents with specific responsibilities
   - Clear flow of control between agents
   - Structured message passing

2. **Enables Context Sharing**
   - Agents can access a shared context pool
   - Context visibility can be configured per agent
   - Support for both focused and broad awareness modes

3. **Allows Self-Modification**
   - Agents can propose and implement improvements to their own behavior
   - System structure can evolve based on task requirements
   - Maintains audit trail of architectural changes

## Key Differences from Existing Systems

### Compared to Renaissance
- More structured agent boundaries
- Optional context isolation
- Explicit message passing between components
- Better scaling with document size

### Compared to LangGraph
- Shared context pool
- Self-modification capabilities
- More flexible agent boundaries
- Runtime architectural evolution

## Design Philosophy

1. **Configurable Isolation**
   - Agents can operate in isolation or with shared context
   - Context visibility can be adjusted based on task requirements
   - Support for both focused and holistic problem-solving

2. **Managed Evolution**
   - System can evolve its structure while maintaining stability
   - Changes are tracked and can be reviewed/rolled back
   - Clear separation between stable and experimental components

3. **Balanced Flexibility**
   - Structured enough for clear reasoning
   - Flexible enough for self-improvement
   - Scalable for complex tasks
