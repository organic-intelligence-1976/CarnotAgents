# CarnotAgents Project Context

## Overview
AI problem-solving system inspired by Carnot engine efficiency principles - creating autonomous agents that maximize productive output through iterative work cycles. Named after Sadi Carnot (though unrelated to thermodynamics), this system applies efficiency optimization to LLM agent architectures.

## Current State
- Status: Active (Consolidating scattered work)
- Created: 2025-07-06
- Phase: Consolidation and architecture refinement
- Priority: HIGH (Complex system needing focus)

## Key Locations
- **Core/**: Framework adapters and unified interfaces
- **Integrations/**: LangChain, AutoGen, LiteLLM, LlamaIndex implementations
- **References/**: Major subsystems
  - `Agent-Delegation/` - Hierarchical agent coordination
  - `Document-Generation/` - Autonomous document creation
  - `Renaissance-Personal/` - Document processing framework
  - `Shared-Architecture/` - Common patterns
- **Research/**: Experimental features and future explorations
  - `PersistentAgents/` - Always-on agents with continuous reasoning loops
- **CONSOLIDATION_NOTES.md** - Tracking scattered materials

## Core Concept: Carnot Efficiency Applied to AI
Just as a Carnot engine achieves maximum thermodynamic efficiency, CarnotAgents aims for:
1. **Maximum productive output** from user inputs
2. **Iterative improvement cycles** (analyze → execute → review → optimize)
3. **Minimal computational waste**
4. **Reversible reasoning chains**

## System Capabilities
- **Autonomous Task Execution**: Complex request handling
- **Project-Level Understanding**: Advance entire projects
- **Document Evolution**: Iterative improvement
- **Self-Reflection**: Performance optimization
- **Framework Agnostic**: Works across LLM providers

## Quick Actions
- "Show CarnotAgents architecture"
- "Run Renaissance document processor"
- "Create multi-agent system"
- "Show framework integrations"

## Development Notes
- Scattered across multiple locations (needs consolidation)
- Combines multiple ambitious subsystems
- Focus on specific use cases vs generic agents
- Integration opportunities with other HQ projects

## Integration Points
- **ArxivPipeline**: Find agent architecture papers
- **ConversationDigest**: Analyze agent conversations
- **RLAgents**: Optimize agent behavior with RL
- **TransformersResearch**: Modern architectures for agents

## TODO
- [x] Import from main ResearchExperiments location
- [x] Import PersistentAgents research as experimental feature
- [ ] Consolidate remaining scattered materials
- [ ] Clean up duplicate files and organize structure
- [ ] Define specific problem domains to target
- [ ] Create working examples for each subsystem
- [ ] Build integration demos with other projects
- [ ] Measure "efficiency" metrics

## Future Research Directions
The **Research/** directory contains experimental features that may inform future development:

### PersistentAgents
- Always-on agents that continue thinking about assigned problems
- Techniques: Tree-of-Thoughts, Reflexion, MemGPT for long-term memory
- Key research question: How to balance persistence with Carnot efficiency principles?
- Status: Early exploration phase - not yet integrated into core system
